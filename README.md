# PSL-ExplainRAG

PSL-ExplainRAG is a self-built RAG-oriented knowledge tool created to help
reason about ambiguity and contextual meaning in Pakistan Sign Language (PSL)
while working on a sign language translation system.

The project focuses on structuring, chunking, and later retrieving
linguistic knowledge for explanation and grounding.

## Day 1
- Defined PSL domain schema
- Implemented knowledge ingestion
- Generated semantic chunks for future retrieval
